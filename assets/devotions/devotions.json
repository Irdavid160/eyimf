Imagine this: A lion is loose in your neighborhood. Not a zoo animal, not a caged beast, but a wild, ravenous predator that has already torn apart some of your neighbors. Would you step outside without a second thought? Would your weapon sit forgotten in the back room while you check the mail? No, you’d be on high alert. Every shadow would make you pause. Every sound would sharpen your instincts. Well, That lion exists. But he is not of flesh and blood.

1st Peter 5:8 “Your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour.”

And yet, so many walk through life oblivious, casual, unarmed, unprepared. They don’t see the danger. They don’t feel the hunt. And so, they fall prey.

How does this lion attack? Well, he roars. In Vrs 9 it says, “Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world.”

A Reality Check: This battle will cost you.

Suffering is inevitable. If you stand for Christ, you will bleed for Christ. And the enemy doesn’t just afflict, he lies. He whispers that your pain is proof that God has abandoned you, that your suffering is meaningless. But suffering is not defeat. It is training. The saints who have gone before you have known this battlefield. Some were imprisoned, some tortured, some killed. And some bore wounds unseen, silent nights of weeping, grief too deep for words. But hear this, warrior: Those who constantly persist in this resistance training do not remain weak.

There is A Promise: Resistance produces results.

Vrs 10 “After that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you.”

This is not a promise for the resurrection—it is a promise for the battlefield. Those who stand firm will be perfected—whether you need completion, repair, or just minor adjustment, God will forge you into what you were meant to be. Those who resist the enemy will be established—unshakable, no longer tossed by every storm. Those who endure suffering will be strengthened—what once crushed you will not even shake you. And those who root themselves in God will be settled—like a tree planted by the waters, unmoved by the winds of life.


The enemy seeks to devour. But those who resist will stand—taller, stronger, unbreakable in Christ.
So hold the line, warrior. Resist on. Stand steadfast. This battle is not about survival—it is about conquering the weaknesses within us and growing more and more each day."

"The Battle Is Decided in the Secret Place


Victory is not truly won when swords clash in the open. The outcome of every war is forged in the stillness before the storm. The warrior who kneels in secret rises in power when the battle comes. It is in those hidden hours, unseen, unheard, uncelebrated, that strength is built, courage is kindled, and faith is made unshakable.

David did not slay Goliath because of his skill with a sling. He conquered the giant because long before the battlefield, in the quiet of the shepherd’s fields, he had learned to lean on God. He sang to Him, trusted Him, and faced lions and bears with a faith that no Philistine could defend against. And when the day came to stand before the enemy, he was already a victor in the secret place.

Even our Lord Jesus did not overcome the cross in the public eye. He overcame when He fell to His knees in the garden, when His sweat became as great drops of blood. The war was won not on Golgotha first, but in Gethsemane, when He bowed His will fully to the Father.

Many think they lose their battles in the heat of the moment. But no, defeat is sown in the days and nights when worldly distractions keep you from the secret place. That place where no eyes are upon you. Where you pray in silence, where you fast without announcement, where your tears fall on unseen altars, and where the sword of The Spirit is sharpened in solitude. That is where warriors rise or fall.

If you neglect the secret place, do not be surprised when the battle overtakes you. But if you train in the presence of God, if you walk with Him in the quiet, you will not tremble when the war cry sounds. Victory is not born in the roar of the crowd, it is forged by groanings which cannot be uttered in a closet.

“But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.” — Matthew 6:6"

    "scripture": "1 Samuel 16:14",
    "body": "A Warrior Without God


King Saul was no coward. He was a warrior-king; a man who led armies, conquered enemies, and stood tall among his people. His presence inspired confidence, his sword once struck fear into the hearts of Israel’s enemies. But in the end, Saul fell, not because he lacked strength, not because he lacked courage, but because he forgot where true strength comes from.

When the prophet Samuel first anointed Saul, he was a man of humility. He hid himself among the people, uncertain, small in his own eyes. But as victories came, so did pride. He began to mistake his position for power, and his success for the favor of God. His heart shifted from dependence to self-reliance. He built monuments to his own name. He obeyed only when it was convenient. And though the Ark of God was still with him, the power of God had already left him.

A position in the church does not make a man great. Authority means nothing if the anointing is gone. Titles crumble. Kingdoms fall. But the favor of God endures beyond thrones and applause. The danger of success is subtle, it whispers that you are the source of what God has given. It tempts you to trust the cheers of men more than the voice of Heaven. But a warrior without God is no warrior at all; he is a sword without an edge, a vessel without oil.
Do not build your confidence on reputation. Do not let your heart rest in the echo of your own name. Let your strength come not from what men see, not from the titles they give, but from the presence of God alone.
One of the most tragic scriptures ever recorded is found in: 1 Samuel 16:14 “But the Spirit of the Lord departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the Lord troubled him.” 

Pride is a thief that steals the anointing. So let us walk softly before the Lord, remembering that every gift, every breath, every victory is His. What He gives, He can take away. But the humble, those who lean wholly on Him, shall never be forsaken."
