  "body": "Imagine this: A lion is loose in your neighborhood. Not a zoo animal, not a caged beast, but a wild, ravenous predator that has already torn apart some of your neighbors. Would you step outside without a second thought? Would your weapon sit forgotten in the back room while you check the mail? No, you’d be on high alert. Every shadow would make you pause. Every sound would sharpen your instincts. Well, that lion exists. But he is not of flesh and blood.\n\n1st Peter 5:8 “Your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour.”\n\nAnd yet, so many walk through life oblivious, casual, unarmed, unprepared. They don’t see the danger. They don’t feel the hunt. And so, they fall prey.\n\nHow does this lion attack? Well, he roars. In verse nine it says, “Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world.”\n\nA Reality Check: This battle will cost you.\n\nSuffering is inevitable. If you stand for Christ, you will bleed for Christ. And the enemy doesn’t just afflict, he afflicts then lies. He whispers that your pain is proof that God has abandoned you, that your suffering is meaningless. But suffering is not defeat. It is training. The saints who have gone before you have known this battlefield. Some were imprisoned, some tortured, some killed. And some bore wounds unseen, silent nights of weeping, grief too deep for words. But hear this, warrior: Those who constantly persist in this resistance training do not remain weak.\n\nThere is A Promise: Resistance produces results.\n\nVerse 10 “After that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you.”\n\nThis is not a promise for the resurrection; it is a promise for the battlefield. Those who stand firm will be perfected, whether you need completion, repair, or just minor adjustment, God will forge you into what you were meant to be. Those who resist the enemy will be established—unshakable, no longer tossed by every storm. Those who endure suffering will be strengthened—what once crushed you will not even shake you. And those who root themselves in God will be settled, like a tree planted by the waters, unmoved by the winds of life.\n\n\nThe enemy seeks to devour. But those who resist will stand—taller, stronger, unbreakable in Christ.\nSo, hold the line, warrior. Resist on. Stand steadfast. This battle is not about survival—it is about conquering the weaknesses within us and growing more and more each day."
