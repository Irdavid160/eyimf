    On my third trip to the Philippines, we began holding <strong>home church services every Sunday</strong>. I remember
    wondering if anyone would come. As the hour approached, I heard the sound of our neighbors walking toward our home, 
    a moment of quiet joy and gratitude.
    The heat was intense, well into the 90s, and our house, with its metal roof and no insulation, felt like an oven.
    Yet it didn’t stop them. Mostly mothers came, a beautiful passel of little ones alongside them, eager to hear the Word.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align:justify;line-height:1.8;">
    I quickly saw the need for more Bibles, but their attentiveness was unmistakable. I taught for about 35 minutes as my
    son Dave translated. I wasn’t used to pausing, so I’d sometimes forget, he was patient, smiling as he caught me up each
    time. At the close of that first service, my precious wife had prepared a simple meal for everyone who came. Her quiet
    strength and loving service continue to bless our ministry.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align:justify;line-height:1.8;">
    When the next Sunday arrived, doubts crept in, <em>would they return?</em> But just like before, I heard footsteps,
    and one by one they came. Services continued faithfully until I returned to the United States due to my mother’s
    medical emergency. Even now, as I prepare to return, the vision has grown: to <strong>train ministers to plant house
    churches in every barangay</strong>. Each barangay functions like its own village, self-governed and close-knit—so
    small house churches fit the rhythm and relationships of the community.

    Feeding Our Community
  </h2>

  <p>
    One of the first things I learned living in the Philippines is how deeply the people of our barangay care for one another. 
    When someone is in need, it isn’t just a family matter — it’s a community matter. This spirit of togetherness inspired our 
    “Feeding Our Community” outreach. It’s not a handout. It’s a shared table, where neighbors bless neighbors.
  </p>

       style="width:100%;max-width:500px;display:block;margin:20px auto;border-radius:10px;box-shadow:0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.15);">

  <p>
    On warm evenings, families and friends come together, sharing food, smiles, and stories. We prepare simple, nourishing 
    meals, not as a gesture of pity but of love and fellowship. It’s about looking someone in the eye and saying, 
    “We’re in this together.” 
  </p>

       style="width:100%;max-width:500px;display:block;margin:20px auto;border-radius:10px;box-shadow:0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.15);">

  <p>
    What began as a small gathering quickly became something the whole barangay looks forward to. Laughter echoes in the air, 
    children play, and the aroma of food reminds us that the simplest acts of kindness often carry the greatest weight.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is what community looks like — not donors and recipients, but friends and family coming together, each with something 
    to give. In these moments, you can feel the love of God at work in a way that words can barely describe.

        What began with the little children of our community sparked a vision that we are praying will become a powerful
        force for the Kingdom of God—a movement that will echo across the Philippine Islands, bringing countless young
        people to the saving knowledge of Jesus Christ.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our next step in this growing mission is to launch a dedicated outreach for youth and young adults. These years
        are full of energy, searching, and difficult choices—and we believe that God’s Word has the power to give
        direction and purpose in this critical season of life.
      </p>

      <p>
        David has a unique heart for this age group. In the early 1990s, he helped found a youth camp in the United States
        that is still transforming lives to this day. His passion is to equip young believers to face real-world
        struggles through Biblical truth and to raise up future leaders who will carry the Gospel far beyond their
        hometowns.
      </p>

      <p>
        The vision is simple but powerful: a space where youth can enjoy fun activities, good food, and meaningful
        friendships—while receiving Biblical teaching that addresses their unique needs. As the network of house churches
        grows, we hope to bring different fellowships together for joint youth sessions and worship nights.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our prayer is that out of these young lives will rise pastors, teachers, evangelists, singers, and musicians who
        will stand boldly for Christ and carry this work forward until His return.
