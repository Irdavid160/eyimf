    Children’s Church
  </h2>

  <p style="text-align:justify;line-height:1.8;">
    On my very first trip to the Philippines, my only intention was to meet the incredible woman I had been talking to for over three years. We began our conversations shortly after COVID began, when her country’s borders were closed to the world. By the time they opened, it took some time before I could travel. My plan was simple: to see if she was truly as amazing as I believed her to be—and she turned out to be a thousand times more amazing—and then begin the process of bringing her to the United States to marry.
  </p>

     style="width:100%;max-width:500px;display:block;margin:20px auto;border-radius:10px;box-shadow:0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.15);">


  <p style="text-align:justify;line-height:1.8;">
    I should say here that the only thing I hate more than hot weather is hot <em>humid</em> weather. I love the four seasons of Ohio and couldn’t imagine living in a country with only two: hot and rainy, and hot and dry. But everything changed once I arrived. I fell in love with the Filipino people—their strength, their joy, and their resilience. I had spent many years in youth ministry in the U.S., founding and preaching in youth camps and services, but the children in the neighborhood were unlike any I had ever encountered.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align:justify;line-height:1.8;">
    They seemed to love me instantly. Whenever I returned from town, I could hear them shouting as I walked back into the barangay. To be fair, the only word I really understood was “Santa,” which is what they called me—no doubt Myrna’s influence. Dave, the amazing young man who would soon become my son, explained what they were saying. It touched my heart so deeply.
  </p>

     style="width:100%;max-width:500px;display:block;margin:20px auto;border-radius:10px;box-shadow:0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.15);">


  <p style="text-align:justify;line-height:1.8;">
    There is no such thing as privacy in our Filipino home. I would be sitting at the kitchen table, reading, and hear a tiny voice say, “Hi Santa.” Looking up, I’d see two to six children peering in through the window, smiling. I’d wave and try to talk with them. Most of the little ones didn’t speak English yet, so conversations were short—but their joy was loud and clear.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align:justify;line-height:1.8;">
    When I returned to the States, I couldn’t get those precious souls off my mind. I prayed and wept for them, their faces vivid in my memory. By the time I returned the next year, I knew I was called to minister to that wonderful community. I shared my vision with Myrna, Dave, and Del, and their excitement was contagious. Myrna went to the market and bought snacks for the kids, while Dave and Del went through the neighborhood announcing that we’d be starting a children’s church in our small living room.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align:justify;line-height:1.8;">
    That first night, twelve children showed up. I read them Bible stories from books I’d brought for that purpose, and we sang the old Sunday School songs—“Jesus Loves Me,” “Father Abraham,” “Zacchaeus Was a Wee Little Man,” and more. It was simple, beautiful, and unforgettable.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align:justify;line-height:1.8;">
    Before long, our little living room was packed with thirty-six children every night. Fifteen minutes before start time, the sound of squealing kids would grow louder outside our door. When Dave or Del finally told them they could come in, it was like a joyful flood poured into our home.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align:justify;line-height:1.8;">
    What began with a few curious faces at the window became the beating heart of our mission in the Philippines. And this is just the beginning of what God has planned as we follow His will for this ministry.

    Home Church Services
  </h2>
  <!-- story content continues here... -->
</section>

        
  <p style="text-align:justify;line-height:1.8;">
    On my third trip to the Philippines, we began holding <strong>home church services every Sunday</strong>. I remember
    wondering if anyone would come. As the hour approached, I heard the sound of our neighbors walking toward our home—
    a moment of quiet joy and gratitude.
    The heat was intense—well into the 90s—and our house, with its metal roof and no insulation, felt like an oven.
    Yet it didn’t stop them. Mostly mothers came, a beautiful passel of little ones alongside them, eager to hear the Word.
  </p>

  <!-- Centered image -->

       style="width:100%;max-width:520px;display:block;margin:18px auto;border-radius:10px;box-shadow:0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.15);">

  <p style="text-align:justify;line-height:1.8;">
    I quickly saw the need for more Bibles, but their attentiveness was unmistakable. I taught for about 35 minutes as my
    son Dave translated. I wasn’t used to pausing, so I’d sometimes forget—he was patient, smiling as he caught me up each
    time. At the close of that first service, my precious wife had prepared a simple meal for everyone who came. Her quiet
    strength and loving service continue to bless our ministry.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align:justify;line-height:1.8;">
    When the next Sunday arrived, doubts crept in—<em>would they return?</em> But just like before, I heard footsteps,
    and one by one they came. Services continued faithfully until I returned to the United States due to my mother’s
    medical emergency. Even now, as I prepare to return, the vision has grown: to <strong>train ministers to plant house
    churches in every barangay</strong>. Each barangay functions like its own village—self-governed and close-knit—so
    small house churches fit the rhythm and relationships of the community.

    Feeding Our Community
  </h2>

  <p>
    One of the first things I learned living in the Philippines is how deeply the people of our barangay care for one another. 
    When someone is in need, it isn’t just a family matter — it’s a community matter. This spirit of togetherness inspired our 
    “Feeding Our Community” outreach. It’s not a handout. It’s a shared table, where neighbors bless neighbors.
  </p>

  <p>
    On warm evenings, families and friends come together, sharing food, smiles, and stories. We prepare simple, nourishing 
    meals, not as a gesture of pity but of love and fellowship. It’s about looking someone in the eye and saying, “We’re in
    this together.”
  </p>

       style="width:100%;max-width:500px;display:block;margin:20px auto;border-radius:10px;box-shadow:0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.15);">

  <p>
    What began as a small gathering quickly became something the whole barangay looks forward to. Laughter echoes in the air, 
    children play, and the aroma of food reminds us that the simplest acts of kindness often carry the greatest weight.
  </p>

  <img src="assets/photos/feeding3.jpg" alt="Feeding event at the barangay"

  <p>
    As the outreach grew, so did the joy of the people. It wasn’t about who had more or who had less—it was about everyone
    bringing something to the table, whether it was food, time, music, or just a smile.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is what community looks like — not donors and recipients, but friends and family coming together, 
    each with something to give. In these moments, you can feel the love of God at work in a way that words can barely describe.
