      <p>
        David (Santa) Riddell is a Christian minister, missionary, and Bible teacher devoted to preaching the Gospel of Jesus Christ and serving in both the United States and the Philippines.
        Raised in a godly home under the ministry of his father, Pastor Paul (Bud) Riddell, David developed a deep love for Scripture from childhood.
      </p>
      <p>
        From a young age he sensed the call of God to preach, beginning a lifelong journey of ministry, revival preaching, evangelism, and youth discipleship. He has preached revivals across America, written and recorded Christ-centered music, and helped launch youth camps that continue to impact young believers.
        Over the years he has witnessed many come to salvation and walk faithfully with the Lord.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today David (Santa) Riddell is actively engaged in mission work in the Philippines, focusing on Gospel evangelism, discipleship, church growth, and Christ-centered community impact.
        Through preaching, online ministry, and grassroots Philippine missions, he seeks to encourage believers, strengthen families, and bring the message of Christ to those in need.
      </p>
      <p>
        His heartbeat remains the same: to hear the Lord say, “Well done,” and to rejoice in Heaven with those whom he has led to Christ.
