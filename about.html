    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>Never in a million years did I imagine I would one day be a missionary in the Philippines. Though I’ve always had a heart for missions and supported many missionaries over the years, I never intended to serve long-term in a foreign country. But when I first visited the Philippines, I not only found the love of my precious soulmate; I also fell in love with the wonderful people of her homeland.</p>

    <p>What began as a plan to bring Myrna to America became God’s plan to bring me here. I wrestled with this calling more than anything the Lord has ever asked of me. My life back home is sweet. I’m very close to my family, immediate and extended, and being part of the largest family in the state of Ohio means there are many loved ones to miss. My children and grandchildren are my world, and I treasure every moment with them.</p>

    <p>But I came to understand something deeply: God’s work is more important than anything else in this life. I don’t see my obedience as a loss, I see it as an investment in eternity. I believe God will give me forever with my family, and I long for the day when I can introduce them to those I’ve led to Christ from this mission field. My desire isn’t for wealth, fame, or power. My greatest joy will be to enter Heaven with a multitude of souls won for the glory of His Kingdom.</p>
