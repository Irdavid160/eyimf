    <h1>About EYIMF</h1>
    <p>
      Examine Yourselves International Mission Foundation exists to glorify the Lord Jesus Christ through
      Gospel-centered evangelism, discipleship, and practical compassion. By God’s grace, we serve local Filipino
      communities—feeding the hungry, clothing the poor, and strengthening the Church through the Word of God.
    </p>

    <h2 class="h2">Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
      To proclaim Christ, equip believers with an understanding of Scripture, and mobilize compassionate action—so that families,
      churches, and communities are transformed for the glory of God.
    </p>

    <h2 class="h2">Our Vision</h2>
    <p>
      A growing network of Scripture-anchored believers, house churches in every barangay (neighborhoods), and local leaders who make disciples,
      care for the vulnerable, and carry the Gospel across the islands and beyond.
    </p>

      relationships, accountability, and local leadership development in every community we serve.
    </p>

    <h2 class="h2" style="margin-top:28px;">Our Story</h2>
    <p>
      What began as simple obedience to the Great Commission has grown into a fellowship of believers committed
      to Scripture, prayer, and practical service. The Lord has opened doors for discipleship gatherings, family
      outreach, and mercy ministries—always grounded in the Gospel.
    </p>

    <h2 class="h2" style="margin-top:28px;">Statement of Faith</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The Holy Bible is the inspired, infallible Word of God and our final authority for faith and practice.</li>
      <li>There is one God, eternally existent in three Persons: Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.</li>
      <li>Salvation is by grace through faith in the finished work of the Lord Jesus Christ.</li>
      <li>True faith produces good works as defined by the Word of God, as the evidence of a transformed life in Christ.</li>
      <li>The Church is called to make disciples of all nations, teaching them to observe all that Christ commanded.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="h2" style="margin-top:28px;">Leadership & Accountability</h2>
    <p>
      EYIMF operates with pastoral counsel, financial oversight, in America and local leadership on the ground.
      We aim to steward every gift with integrity, transparency, and thanksgiving to God.
