      <h1>About EYIMF</h1>
      <p>
        Examine Yourselves International Mission Foundation exists to glorify the Lord Jesus Christ through
        Gospel-centered evangelism, discipleship, and practical compassion. By God’s grace, we serve local Filipino
        communities with food, clothing, and by strengthening the Church through the Word of God.
      </p>

      <h2 class="h2">Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        To proclaim Christ, equip believers with an understanding of Scripture, and mobilize compassionate action—so that
        families, churches, and communities are transformed for the glory of God.
      </p>

      <h2 class="h2">Our Vision</h2>
      <p>
        A growing network of Scripture-anchored believers, house churches in every barangay (neighborhood), and local
        leaders who make disciples, care for the vulnerable, and carry the Gospel across the islands and beyond.
      </p>

      <h2 class="h2" style="margin-top:28px;">Where We Serve</h2>
      <p>

        relationships, accountability, and local leadership development in every community we serve.
      </p>

      <h2 class="h2" style="margin-top:28px;">Our Story</h2>
<p>
      Never in a million years did I imagine I would one day be a missionary in the Philippines.
      Though I’ve always had a heart for missions and supported many missionaries over the years,
      I never intended to serve long-term in a foreign country. But when I first visited the Philippines,
      I not only found the love of my precious soulmate; I also fell in love with the wonderful people of her homeland.
    </p>
    <p>
      What began as a plan to bring Myrna to America became God’s plan to bring me here.
      I wrestled with this calling more than anything the Lord has ever asked of me. My life back home is sweet.
      I’m very close to my family, immediate and extended, and being part of the largest family in the state of Ohio
      means there are many loved ones to miss. My children and grandchildren are my world, and I treasure every moment with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I came to understand something deeply: God’s work is more important than anything else in this life.
      I don’t see my obedience as a loss, I see it as an investment in eternity.
      I believe God will give me forever with my family, and I long for the day when I can introduce them
      to those I’ve led to Christ from this mission field. My desire isn’t for wealth, fame, or power.
      My greatest joy will be to enter Heaven with a multitude of souls won for the glory of His Kingdom.
    </p>

      <h2 class="h2" style="margin-top:28px;">Statement of Faith</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The Holy Bible is the inspired, infallible Word of God and our final authority for faith and practice.</li>
        <li>There is one God, eternally existent in three Persons: Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.</li>
        <li>Salvation is by grace through faith in the finished work of the Lord Jesus Christ.</li>
        <li>True faith produces good works as defined by the Word of God, as the evidence of a transformed life in Christ.</li>
        <li>The Church is called to make disciples of all nations, teaching them to observe all that Christ commanded.</li>
      </ul>
