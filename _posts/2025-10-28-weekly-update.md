## A Season of Testing and Grace

Let me first say how much I **love and appreciate my sweet wife**. This has been a very difficult time for her. Within days of our wedding, I had to return to America due to my mother suffering a stro[...]  

Momma was always the one who took care of us, and now we are the ones taking care of her. The pain of seeing her instantly go from living alone, driving herself to church and the market, to now needin[...]  

## A Rock Beside Me

Through all of this, **Myrna has been a rock**. I have seen the pain in her face when she whispers, *“umuwi ka na”* (come home), and then immediately changes and says, *“but Momma needs you righ[...]  

## Pain, Faith, and New Strength

During this time back in America, I have also endured intense pain in my lower back, which put me on my back for nearly four months. Most days, I could only sit or stand for 20 to 30 minutes. Standing[...]  

But in this ordeal, I found a **new love and deeper understanding of my God** and His will for my life. If you haven’t been following my devotions on Facebook and YouTube, I encourage you to take a [...]  

Ironically, my health battle isn’t fully over, but the change God has made in me makes me feel like it is. I still hurt—some days more than others—but my heart leaps like a fawn in the meadow as[...]

My burden for my Philippine community has intensified, and with that so has my vision. I have a **bold new mission** planned for when I return, and I have full faith that God will help make that visio[...]  

I’m praying to acquire a different home so that we can turn our current one into a **church**. I’m looking at used electric pianos with weighted keys, a bass guitar, and electric drums to add to t[...]  

I want to train godly musicians and give them an outlet to worship. I’m also working on a ministry training curriculum for those who feel the call to ministry so they can go into other barangays and[...]  

## Reaching the Next Generation

We were already having Children’s Church and an adult-centered service, but upon my return, I plan to establish a **Youth Outreach Program**. The youth have always been close to my heart, and I beli[...]  

## How You Can Help

We’ve created a budget to help bring this vision to life, and we’re praying that God will move the hearts of His people in America to support us. If **151 people** give just **$20 a month**, we’[...]  

You can see the budget breakdown on our [Updates Page](https://www.santamissions.org).

But more than anything, our greatest need is **your prayers**—that God would anoint us with His Spirit to break the yoke of bondage. Please remember us as we labor for our Master.
