## A Season of Testing and Grace

Let me first say how much I **love and appreciate my sweet wife**. This has been a very difficult time for her. Within days of our wedding, I had to return to America due to my mother suffering a stroke

Momma was always the one who took care of us, and now we are the ones taking care of her. The pain of seeing her instantly go from living alone, driving herself to church and the market, to now needing help with everything.

## A Rock Beside Me

Through all of this, **Myrna has been a rock**. I have seen the pain in her face when she whispers, *‚Äúumuwi ka na‚Äù* (come home), and then immediately changes and says, *‚Äúbut Momma needs you right now.*

## Pain, Faith, and New Strength

During this time back in America, I have also endured intense pain in my lower back, which put me on my back for nearly four months. Most days, I could only sit or stand for 20 to 30 minutes. Standing for long periods was impossible.

But in this ordeal, I found a **new love and deeper understanding of my God** and His will for my life. If you haven‚Äôt been following my devotions on Facebook and YouTube, I encourage you to take a look at them.

Ironically, my health battle isn‚Äôt fully over, but the change God has made in me makes me feel like it is. I still hurt‚Äîsome days more than others‚Äîbut my heart leaps like a fawn in the meadow as I run through the tall grass.

## A Bold Vision for the Philippines

My burden for my Philippine community has intensified, and with that so has my vision. I have a **bold new mission** planned for when I return, and I have full faith that God will help make that vision a reality.

I‚Äôm praying to acquire a different home so that we can turn our current one into a **church**. I‚Äôm looking at used electric pianos with weighted keys, a bass guitar, and electric drums to add to the collection.

I want to train godly musicians and give them an outlet to worship. I‚Äôm also working on a ministry training curriculum for those who feel the call to ministry so they can go into other barangays and spread the Gospel.

## Reaching the Next Generation

We were already having Children‚Äôs Church and an adult-centered service, but upon my return, I plan to establish a **Youth Outreach Program**. The youth have always been close to my heart, and I believe God has great plans for them.

## How You Can Help

We‚Äôve created a budget to help bring this vision to life, and we‚Äôre praying that God will move the hearts of His people in America to support us. If **151 people** give just **$20 a month**, we‚Äôll have the funds to make it happen.

You can see the budget breakdown on our [Updates Page](https://www.santamissions.org).

But more than anything, our greatest need is **your prayers**‚Äîthat God would anoint us with His Spirit to break the yoke of bondage. Please remember us as we labor for our Master.

> *‚ÄúNot by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the LORD of hosts.‚Äù* ‚Äî Zechariah 4:6

God Bless,
